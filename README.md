# Design of Algorithms (DA) - 1st Project

This assignment aims to expose students to realistic implementations of algorithmic solutions presented in class, and in particular to the greedy algorithmic approach in the context of maximum-flow problems. 

Students are asked to implement an analysis tool that can support the Management Team of a water supply network in Portugal to make informed decisions about how to best allocate its resources, both financial as well as physical (e.g., procurement of new pumping stations or installing new pipelines). Such a tool will allow management to decide on aspects such as how to best assign selected pumping stations to supply sources and how to identify more sensitive sections of its network to failures to anticipate service disruption or at least to mitigate its nefarious effects.
